To understand AJAX  we need to understand callbacks and event loop 

 Promises: callbacks create a problem called callback hell or  'pyramid of doom' which is nothing but nested callbacks
 multiple times . callback hell code is diffucult to read and maintaine to avoiid this problem we use Promises
 promis is an object which describes an eventual completion of asycnhrounous operation or task it contains three states
  1.pending
  2.fullfilled
  3.rejected
the default state is pending 
a promise cab be handled using .then .catch
promis
.then(callback())
.catch(callbacks())

the series of promises connected to each other is called promise chaining

API(Apllication Programmig Interface): are used to communicate between two softwares basically client and server client
request to the server using api and server respond to the client using api APi are created and maintained by the server 
client recieves the promise whenever it request to the api on ce the prpmises resolved it recieves the data through api
