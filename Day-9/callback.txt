Callback Fuctions: Callback fuction are the function which are passed as a parameter to another function
  eg   
      function mad(){
        console.log("Im mad")'
      }

      function fun(x){
        x()
      }
      fun(mad);

      the function which passed as parameter is called callback function
      the fuction which take the function as a parameter is called higher order function

      function greet(name,fun){
    fun(name)
}

function Sayname(n){
console.log(`My name is ${n}`)
}
greet("Junaid",Sayname)
 here Sayname is passed as a argument to another function so it is callback fuction
 and greet is receiving fuction so it is higher ordere fuction          

 Closures: Closures is a memory technique in which innner loops/function remmmber the outer
  loop/function value even after outer loop/function execution ended;(leetcode30 Day)
  
  eg
  
function outer(){
      let a = 5;
      function inner(){
        console.log(a);
      }
      return inner
}

let x = outer()
console.log(x())

IIFE:(Immdediate function Expression): An iife is a function that is defined and invoked immediatley 
it is used to hide the data from the global scop

  eg:
     (function(){
        console.log("Hi);
     })();
