the third approach explain Object oriented Progamming . it constanstly foucus on objects
objects will have properites and methods

clas is a standard/ blueprint of object it contains muliple objects so 
class Fruit
{
clor;ship;name;taste;
}
apple is an boject which is from class Fruit
//To create objec t we sue keyword new -- to generate dynamic memory 
let apple  = new Fruit();
let banana = new Fruit();

//Inheritance: when a class is derived from another  class it called Inheritance

destructuring in objects or arrays:
let arr=[5,4,6,9];//destructuring of arrays
let [a,b,c,d]=arr;

let person ={
  name:"Junaid",
  age:55
}
let {name,age}=person;//destructuring of object

Rest of the parameters: it is represented by ... and it will used to collect all the rest of the parameters ans store 
them as an array. it is always written at last parameters

let  [a,...b] = ["raj","junaid","sonu"];
console.log(a)// raj
console.log(b)//junaid sonu

Spread opertor: it is used to spread out the array. its alos represented by ... dots

let a =[1,2];
let b =[3,4];
let c = [...a,..b]
